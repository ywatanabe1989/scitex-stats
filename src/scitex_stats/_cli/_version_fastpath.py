"""Fast-path a bare ``-V``/``--version`` CLI invocation.

Must run BEFORE any import in ``_cli/__init__.py`` that transitively pulls
in ``scitex_dev._cli`` (e.g. via ``attach_scitex_dev_integrations`` /
``attach_shell_completion``). scitex-dev's own ``_cli/__init__.py`` has an
identical fast-path: it inspects the process-wide ``sys.argv`` and, if it
looks like a bare ``-V``/``--version``, immediately prints *scitex-dev's
own* version and calls ``sys.exit(0)`` — as an IMPORT-TIME side effect,
with no way to tell whose CLI is actually running.

Without an equally early check here, running ``scitex-stats -V`` (or
``python -m scitex_stats -V``) would import ``scitex_dev._cli`` partway
through this package's own CLI import. That import sees the SAME
``sys.argv`` and hijacks the process: it prints ``scitex-dev X.Y.Z`` and
exits before scitex-stats's own ``click.version_option`` ever runs — the
observed bug (``scitex-stats --version`` printing ``scitex-dev 0.28.0``).

Deliberately narrow — any other combination (extra flags, a subcommand,
``--version --json``) is left alone and falls through to the real Click
group unchanged.
