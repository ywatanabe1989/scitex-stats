#         Statistical power (probability of detecting effect if it exists)
#
#     Notes
#     -----
#     Statistical power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis
#     when the alternative hypothesis is true. In other words, it's the
#     probability of correctly detecting an effect when it exists.
#
#     Power = P(reject H0 | H1 is true)
#
#     Common power benchmarks:
#     - 0.80 (80%): Minimum acceptable power (Cohen, 1988)
#     - 0.90 (90%): High power
#     - 0.95 (95%): Very high power
#
#     For two-sample tests, this function assumes equal sample sizes by default.
#     If n1 and n2 differ, the harmonic mean is used:
#
#     .. math::
#         n_{eff} = \\frac{2 n_1 n_2}{n_1 + n_2}
